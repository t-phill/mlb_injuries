# preliminary proposal

##Proposal 1##: 

**High level description of project.**

I'm looking to predict pitching injuries in major league baseball using machine learning. 

**What question or problem are you trying to solve?**

I'm looking to answer the question: Is it possible to predict injuries in MLB pitchers before they happen in order to intervene/prevent them. I'll be Looking at pitching mechanics(pitchFX), days rest, other statcast data.

**How will you present your work?**

Looking to utilize a web app which will be interactive.

**What are your data sources?**

The relevant data exists: statcast, baseball-savant, retrosheet data.

**What’s your next step towards making this your project.**

My next step is researching what has already been done and to examine areas for improvement and figuring out a way to tie statcast data to throwing mechanics. 

##Proposal 2##:

**High level description of project.**

I'm looking to attempt predicting 'win or lose' for regular season games using historical data and feature engineering. 

**What question or problem are you trying to solve?**

The appeal and or problem in baseball is that the best team doesn't always win. Can the outcome or regular season games be predicted? If so, how do machine learning methods compare to Vegas? Is baseball data too 'noisy' to predict outcome?

**How will you present your work?**

I would present the work using a presentation.

**What are your data sources?**

Similar to proposal 1, the baseball data exists and should be easily attainable. Statcast, baseball-savant, retrosheet

**What’s your next step towards making this your project.**

Next steps regarding making this my project is making a determination if the idea is worth pursuing? Come up with better reasons than simply trying to beat Vegas. 

##Proposal 3a##:

**High level description of project.**

I'll be attempting to predict casing/mechanical failures in the/an oilfield(which one?)

**What question or problem are you trying to solve?**

I'd be looking to answer the question: Can you predic mechanical failures before they happen in order to prevent environmental damage/cleanup expenses?

**How will you present your work?**

I would present the project using a presentation.

**What are your data sources?**

The question is to be determined. I'm not sure what data is available regarding production data/authorization for expenditures. Would also manufacturing information of parts.

**What’s your next step towards making this your project.**

My next step would be determing the availability of such data.
